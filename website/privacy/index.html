                            If you load slides from third-party websites, there is
                            no guarantee they will also respect your privacy.

                <h2>Applicability</h2>

                <p>
                    This document only applies to unmodified and local
                    instances of Persuade (Local Instances), or the hosted
                    instances under the <i>persuade.pietroalbini.org</i> domain
                    (Hosted Instances).
                </p>

                <h2>Collected data</h2>

                <p>
                    Persuade doesn't send any data about your slides or what
                    you're doing with the application to any server: everything
                    happens locally on your device, to respect your privacy.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you're using an Hosted Instance though, the only data
                    collected is your web browser's user agent and your IP
                    address.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This data is automatically sent by your web browser, and
                    it's needed for the web server to work. It's stored in the
                    server logs for a month, for diagnosistics and abuse
                    prevention purposes. It might also be stored in the server
                    backups.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Also, no cookies are stored on your device.
                </p>

                <h2>Loading slides from third-party websites</h2>

                <p>
                    If you load slides from third-party websites, there's no
                    guarantee they will also respect your privacy: you should
                    check their privacy policy, because other websites are not
                    covered by this one.
